1.Initialization settings, including population size N, initial position of each copepod, copepod visual field, step, congestion 
factor δ, and repetition number Try−number;

2.Calculate the fitness value of each initial copepod school, and assign the best copepod status and its value to the bulletin board;

3.Evaluate each individual and select the behavior to be performed, including foraging, gathering, following, and random behavior;

4.Perform the behavior of copepod, update itself, generate new copepod school;
copepod
5.Evaluate all individuals. If a body is better than the bulletin board, the bulletin board is updated to the individual;

6.The algorithm ends when the optimal solution on the bulletin board reaches within the satisfaction error bound or reaches the 
upper limit of the iterations, otherwise it proceeds to step 3.




The bulletin board means:
It is the place where the individual state of the optimal copepod is recorded. Each copepod compares its current 
state with the state recorded in the bulletin board after performing one iteration. If it is better than the state in the bulletin 
board. It updates the state in the bulletin board with its own state. Otherwise, the state of the bulletin board remains unchanged.
When the iteration of the entire algorithm is over, the bulletin board value is the optimal solution.
